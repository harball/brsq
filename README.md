**bourrasque is a fictional aircraft designed to enjoy flying !!!**

It is usable in [FLIGHTGEAR open source flight simulator](http://www.flightgear.org).

It is agile and powerful, can fly fast and do short takeoffs and landings.
It's a suitable aircraft to discover the whole world of flightgear (entirely earth is available) with its radio-navigation instruments and autopilot.
